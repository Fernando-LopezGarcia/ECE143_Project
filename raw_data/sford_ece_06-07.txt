UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
The mission of the undergraduate program of the Department of 

Electrical Engineering is to augment the liberal education expected of 
all Stanford undergraduates and impart a basic understanding of electri-
cal engineering built on a foundation of physical science, mathematics, 
computing, and technology.

Graduates of the undergraduate program are expected to possess 
knowledge of the fundamentals of electrical engineering and of at least one 
specialty area. The graduates are expected to have the basic experimental, 
design, and communication skills to be prepared for continued study at the 
graduate level or for entry-level positions that require a basic knowledge 
of electrical engineering, science, and technology.

The educational objectives of the program are:
1. Technical knowledge: provide a basic knowledge of electrical engi-

neering principles along with the required supporting knowledge of 
computing, engineering fundamentals, mathematics, and science. The 
program must include depth in at least one specialty area, currently 
including computer hardware, computer software, controls, circuits, 
fields and waves, communication and signal processing, and semicon-
ductor and photonic devices.

2. Laboratory and design skills: develop the basic skills needed to perform 
and design experimental projects. Develop the ability to formulate 
problems and projects and to plan a process for solution, taking ad-
vantage of diverse technical knowledge and skills.

3. Communications skills: develop the ability to organize and present 
information and to write and speak effective English.

4. Preparation for further study: provide sufficient breadth and depth for 
successful subsequent graduate study, postgraduate study, or lifelong 
learning programs.

5. Preparation for the profession: provide an appreciation for the broad 
spectrum of issues arising in professional practice, including econom-
ics, ethics, leadership, professional organizations, safety, service, and 
teamwork.
To specialize in Electrical Engineering (EE), undergraduates should 

follow the depth sequence given in the discussion of undergraduate pro-
grams in the “School of Engineering” section of this bulletin. Students 
are required to have a program planning sheet approved by their adviser 
and the department prior to the end of the quarter following the quarter in 
which they declare their major and at least one year prior to graduation. 
Program sheets for the general EE requirements and for each of the EE 
specialty sequences may be found at http://ughb.stanford.edu. Majors must 
receive at least a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) in courses taken for the EE 
depth requirement; all classes must be taken for a letter grade.

For information about an EE minor, see the “School of Engineering” 
section of this bulletin.

A Stanford undergraduate may work simultaneously toward the B.S. 
and M.S. degrees. See “Dual and Coterminal Degree Programs” in the 
“School of Engineering” section of this bulletin.

HONORS
The Department of Electrical Engineering offers a program leading to 

a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with honors. This program 
offers a unique opportunity for qualified undergraduate majors to conduct 
independent study and research at an advanced level with a faculty mentor, 
graduate students, and fellow undergraduates.

Admission to the honors program is by application. Declared EE 
students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 in Electrical 
Engineering are eligible to submit an application. Applications must be 
submitted by Autumn quarter of the senior year, be signed by the thesis 
adviser and second reader (one must be a member of the EE Faculty), and 
include an honors proposal. Students need to declare honors on Axess.

In order to receive departmental honors, students admitted to the 
honors program must:
1. maintain a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 in EE courses
2. complete at least 10 units of EE 191 for a letter grade with their project 

adviser
3. submit two final copies of the honors thesis approved by the adviser 

and second reader
4. attend poster and oral presentation in the Electrical Engineering Honors 

Symposium held at the end of Spring Quarter or present in another 
suitable forum approved by the faculty adviser.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS
University regulations governing the M.S., Engineer, and Ph.D. 

degrees are described in the “Graduate Degrees” section of this bulletin.
The profession of electrical engineering demands a strong foundation 

in physical science and mathematics, a broad knowledge of engineering 
techniques, and an understanding of the relationship between technology 
and man. Curricula at Stanford are planned to offer the breadth of educa-
tion and depth of training necessary for leadership in the profession. To 
engage in this profession with competence, four years of undergraduate 
study and at least one year of postgraduate study are recommended. For 
those who plan to work in highly technical development or fundamental 
research, additional graduate study is desirable. 

A one- to two-year program of graduate study in Electrical Engineer-
ing may lead to the degree of Master of Science. The program is typically 
completed in five academic quarters. A two- to three-year program, offer-
ing a wider selection of engineering course work, more opportunity for 
study in the related fields of engineering, mathematics, and physics, and 
in particular, more independent work and individual guidance, may lead 
to the degree of Engineer. 

The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is offered under the general regu-
lations of the University. The doctoral program, requiring a minimum of 
135 units of graduate study, should be considered by those with the ability 
and desire to make a life work of research or teaching.

Application for Admission—Applications for admission with graduate 
standing in Electrical Engineering (EE) should be completed electronically 
at http://gradadmissions.stanford.edu. For more information concerning 
Electrical Engineering graduate admissions, see http://ee-admissions.
stanford.edu. The application deadline for admission for Autumn Quarter 
2007-08 is December 12, 2006.

MASTER OF SCIENCE
Students with undergraduate degrees in physics, mathematics, or re-

lated sciences, as well as in various branches of engineering, are invited 
to apply for admission. They should typically be able to complete the 
master’s degree in five academic quarters; note that many courses are not 
taught during the summer. Students with undergraduate degrees in other 
fields may also be admitted for graduate study; see below.

The master’s degree program may provide advanced preparation for 
professional practice or for teaching on the junior college level, or it may 
serve as the first step in graduate work leading to the degree of Engineer 
or Ph.D. The faculty does not prescribe specific courses to be taken. Each 
student, with the help of a program adviser, prepares an individual program 
and submits it to the faculty for approval. The master’s program proposal 
must be submitted to the department office during the first quarter of gradu-

ate study; modifications may be made later. Detailed requirements and 
instructions are in the Handbook for Graduate Students in Electrical En-
gineering at Stanford University (http://ee.stanford.edu/gradhandbook/). 
Programs of at least 45 quarter units that meet the following guidelines are 
normally approved. Cognate (extradepartmental) courses of the appropri-
ate level are considered as Electrical Engineering courses.
1. A sequence of three or more letter-graded electrical engineering courses 

numbered above 200, to provide depth in one area. The student must 
maintain an average 3.0 grade point average (GPA) or better in both 
the depth area and overall.

2. At least one letter-graded EE course numbered above 200 in each of 
three distinct course areas outside of the area selected under item 1 to 
provide breadth. Two courses are not considered to be in distinct areas 
if they can be found under a common depth area.

3. Enough additional units of EE courses so that items 1 through 3 total at 
least 21 units of letter-graded EE courses numbered above 200, includ-
ing at least 9 units of such courses numbered in the 300s or 400s. Some 
600- or 700-level summer courses may also be considered for inclusion 
in the M.S. program. Special studies units may not be used.

4. Additional course work to bring the total to 45 or more quarter units, 
including:
a) at least 36 letter-graded units
b) at least 36 units at or above the 100 level
c) at least 30 units in technical areas such as engineering, mathematics, 

and science; thesis and special studies units cannot be included.
5. The EE 201A seminar in Autumn Quarter and either (a) one formal EE 

seminar course for credit, or (b) attend a minimum of eight informal or 
formal EE research seminars, and submit with the final M.S. program 
a list of the seminars with a paragraph describing the content and the 
signature of the M.S. adviser. This requirement is to ensure that students 
sample the many available research seminars. In case of conflict with 
EE 201A, tapes may be viewed in Terman Library.
Capable students without formal undergraduate preparation in electri-

cal engineering may also be admitted for graduate study. Such students 
may have graduated in any field and may hold either the B.S. or B.A. 
degree. Each student, with the help of an adviser, prepares a program of 
study to meet particular needs and submits it to the faculty for approval. 
A student with adequate preparation in mathematics through calculus and 
college physics including electricity can usually complete the M.S. degree 
requirements within two academic years. A student with some additional 
preparation in electrical engineering may be able to complete the M.S. 
requirements in only one academic year.

Graduate study in EE demands that students be adequately prepared in 
circuits, digital systems, fields, lab work, mathematics, and physics. Skill 
in using modern computing facilities is essential for electrical engineers, 
and an increasing number of courses routinely require it. Skill should be 
acquired early in the program, either by taking one of the regular computer 
science courses or one of the special short courses given by the Computa-
tion Center, or by self-study.

It is the student’s responsibility, in consultation with an adviser, to 
determine whether the prerequisites for advanced courses have been met. 
Prerequisite courses ordinarily taken by undergraduates may be included 
as part of the graduate program of study. However, if the number of these is 
large, the proposed program may contain more than the typical 45 units, and 
the time required to meet the degree requirements may be increased.

Students working toward the Master of Science degree in Electrical 
Engineering who are considering a Ph.D. or Engineer degree program 
in Electrical Engineering at Stanford must request the addition of a new 
degree program by submitting a Graduate Program Authorization Peti-
tion for approval by the department. Once the M.S. degree in EE has been 
conferred, a student may not register for additional course work without 
this approval. Permission to study beyond the M.S. degree is normally 
granted to students who were originally admitted to the Ph.D. program 
if the student:
1. has passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination within the past year, or
2. has a written commitment from a regular member of the EE faculty to 

serve as an Engineer or Ph.D. dissertation adviser, and has a satisfac-
tory academic record to date.

Stanford Bulletin, 2006-07 |  �

Students originally admitted only for the M.S. degree and not to the 
Ph.D. program may petition the EE graduate admissions committee during 
Autumn Quarter of their second year at Stanford for a change of status to 
the Ph.D. program with permission to take the Ph.D. qualifying exam in 
January. Requirements for the petition include a grade point average of 
3.5 on Stanford courses and a written statement of support from an EE 
faculty member with whom the student has conducted preliminary research 
through directed reading (EE 390 or 391) or as part of a 300-level project 
course. Decisions are based on performance and the strength of the sup-
port letter. If admitted to the Ph.D. program, permission to study beyond 
the M.S. degree is normally granted under the same conditions as those 
described above for students originally admitted to the Ph.D. program. 
Students not admitted to the Ph.D. program are normally granted permis-
sion to continue past the M.S. degree only if there is a written commitment 
from a regular member of the EE faculty to serve as an Engineer dissertation 
supervisor. The student should file for candidacy for the Engineer degree 
within one quarter of receiving the M.S. 

ENGINEER
The degree of Engineer requires a minimum of 90 units of residency. 

Units completed at Stanford towards a master’s degree in an Engineering 
discipline may be used towards the 90-unit residency requirement for the 
Engineer degree. A student who received an M.S. degree elsewhere can 
transfer in 45 units towards the 90-unit requirement for an Engineer’s 
degree. A student would need to fill out the Application for Graduate 
Residency Credit form to be filed with the Degree Progress Office in the 
Registrar’s Office.

Work toward the degree of Engineer in Electrical Engineering normally 
includes the requirements for work toward the master’s degree in Electrical 
Engineering, including qualifications for admission.

An additional year allows time for a broader program, or a more 
concentrated program, or whatever arrangement may seem suitable to 
the candidate, his adviser, and the department. Advanced study at other 
universities, or in other departments at Stanford, may be allowed within 
the foregoing consideration. The equivalent of approximately one quarter 
is devoted to independent study and thesis work with faculty guidance. 
The thesis is often of the nature of a professional report on the solution of 
a design problem. The degree of Engineer differs from the Ph.D. in that it 
prepares for professional engineering work rather than theoretical research. 
The candidate may select courses that are suitable for either the degree of 
Engineer or the Ph.D. degree and decide later which program to pursue.

The best procedure for the applicant to follow is (1) if now work-
ing toward the Stanford M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, request 
permission to continue graduate studies beyond the master’s degree, 
using the Graduate Program Authorization Petition form obtained from 
the Department of Electrical Engineering office, or (2) if not planning 
to receive the Stanford M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, apply for 
admission to the Department of Electrical Engineering as a candidate for 
the degree of Engineer.

During the first quarter of work beyond the M.S. degree, formal ap-
plication for admission to candidacy for the degree of Engineer is made 
on a form that can be obtained from the department office. The program 
of study is prepared by the student with the help of the thesis adviser 
and submitted to the academic associate for approval. The form should 
contain a list of all graduate courses completed at Stanford and elsewhere 
and all courses yet to be completed. For the most recent information, see 
http://ee.stanford.edu/gradhandbook/engineer.html.

DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY
Admission to a graduate program does not imply that the student is 

a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. Advancement to candidacy requires 
superior academic achievement, satisfactory performance on a qualifying 
examination, and sponsorship by two faculty members. Enrollment in EE 
391, Special Studies, is recommended as a means for getting acquainted 
with a faculty member who might be willing to serve as a supervisor.

Students admitted to the Ph.D. program should submit an application 
to take the department qualifying examination (given each Winter Quar-
ter). Upon completion of the qualifying examination and after securing 

agreement by two faculty members to serve as dissertation advisers, the 
student should file an Application for Doctoral Candidacy. The Ph.D. in 
Electrical Engineering is a specialized degree, and is built on a broad base 
of physics, mathematics, and engineering skills. The course program is 
expected to reflect competency in Electrical Engineering and specialized 
study in other areas relevant to the student’s research focus. Normally the 
majority of units are drawn from EE department or cognate courses, with 
typically 9 units from related advanced physics, mathematics, engineer-
ing, or computer science courses, depending on the area of research. Only 
after receiving department approval to that application does the student 
become a candidate for the Ph.D. degree.

Requirements may be summarized as follows. The student must com-
plete (1) a minimum of 135 units of residence with graduate standing at 
Stanford; (2) one or more qualifying examinations given by the faculty 
of the Department of Electrical Engineering; (3) an approved course of 
study in Electrical Engineering; (4) an approved program of research and 
a written dissertation, based on research, which must be a contribution to 
knowledge; (5) an oral examination that is a defense of dissertation research 
and is taken near the completion of the doctoral program.

PH.D. MINOR
For a minor in Electrical Engineering (EE), the student must fulfill the 

M.S. depth requirement, complete a total of at least 20 units of course work 
at the 200-plus level in electrical engineering (of which 15 units must be 
graded) and be approved by the department’s Ph.D. Degree Committee. A 
grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.35 on these courses is required.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
The department awards a limited number of fellowships, teaching and 

course assistantships, and research assistantships to incoming graduate stu-
dents. Applying for such assistance is part of the admission application.

THE HONORS COOPERATIVE PROGRAM
Many of the department’s graduate students are supported by the 

Honors Cooperative Program (HCP), which makes it possible for aca-
demically qualified engineers and scientists in nearby companies to be 
part-time graduate students in Electrical Engineering while continuing 
nearly full-time professional employment. Prospective HCP students 
follow the same admission process and must meet the same admission 
requirements as full-time graduate students. For more information regard-
ing the Honors Cooperative Program, see the “School of Engineering” 
section of this bulletin.

AREAS OF RESEARCH
Candidates for advanced degrees participate in the research activities 

of the department as paid research assistants or as students of individual 
faculty members. At any one time, certain areas of research have more 
openings than others. A new applicant should express a second choice of 
research interest in the event that there are no vacancies in the primary area 
of interest. At present, faculty members and students are actively engaged 
in research in the areas listed below.

COMMUNICATIONS
Adaptive Modulation and Coding
Adaptive Multiuser Coding and Reception
