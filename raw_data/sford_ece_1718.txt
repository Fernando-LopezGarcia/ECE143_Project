EE 14N: Things about Stuff
Preference to freshmen. The stories behind disruptive inventions such as the telegraph, telephone, wireless, television, transistor, and chip are as important as the inventions themselves, for they elucidate broadly applicable scientific principles. Focus is on studying consumer devices; projects include building batteries, energy conversion devices and semiconductors from pocket change. Students may propose topics and projects of interest to them. The trajectory of the course is determined in large part by the students themselves.

EE 21N: What is Nanotechnology?
Nanotechnology is an often used word and it means many things to different people. Scientists and Engineers have some notion of what nanotechnology is, societal perception may be entirely different. In this course, we start with the classic paper by Richard Feynman ("There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"), which laid down the challenge to the nanotechnologists. Then we discuss two classic books that offer a glimpse of what nanotechnology is: Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology by Eric Drexler, and Prey by Michael Crichton. Drexler's thesis sparked the imagination of what nano machinery might do, whereas Crichton's popular novel channeled the public's attention to this subject by portraying a disastrous scenario of a technology gone astray. We will use the scientific knowledge to analyze the assumptions and predictions of these classic works. We will draw upon the latest research advances to illustrate the possibilities and impossibilities of nanotechnology.

EE 26N: The Wireless World, and the Data You Leak
The world is increasingly based on wireless communication. Cell phones and WiFi are the most visible examples. Others are key fobs, water meters, gas and electric meters, garage door openers, baby monitors, and the list continues to expand. All of these produce RF signals you can detect and often decode. This seminar will explore how much information you broadcast throughout your day, and how it can easily be received and decoded using inexpensive hardware and public domain software. You will be able to explain why different information services use different frequencies, why they encode the information the way they do, and what security risks they present.

EE 392K: Self-Programming Networks
This is an advanced topics course on building autonomous networks using data and techniques from machine learning. It covers two major application areas: Cloud Computing Systems and Mobile Wireless Networks. The course introduces the architecture of Self-Programming Networks for sensing, inferring, learning and control, consisting of (i) a "reflex layer" for inferring at line rate and at scale, and (ii) a "deliberate layer" for efficient resource scheduling and network control. Various sensing and inference algorithms for deriving insights and alerts from the sensed data will be discussed. Methods for synchronizing clocks across a large data center and using this to reconstruct the fine details of network performance (queue-depths, link utilizations and buffer and link compositions) in near real-time will be presented. Similarly, methods for inferring available bandwidth in dynamic mobile networks and using it to drive different application optimizations will be presented. Students will learn the use of neural networks and learning techniques (a) to accelerate inference and control algorithms, (b) for "workload fingerprinting", (c) for predicting wireless link capacities, and (d) for scheduling resources. Finally, the principles of creating an interactive database for detecting anomalies, raising alerts, and serving insights to the user will be discussed. The course involves a team-based project.
