## Analysis of Course offerings of Top Engineering Universities in the USA
1. What are the most common skills that have been promoted by Departments from a particular university? 
2. How have the course offerings changed for different departments in the same University over time? 
Has the UCSD CSE department had more changes/more frequent changes than the UCSD Mechanical Engineering department?
Does this reflect on the state of the industries that they are concerned with? (IT, Software sector is far more dynamic, and hence the CSE department has to change faster to keep up?)
3. How have the offerings changed for the same department across different Universities ( say has the UCSD ECE department been as dynamic as the MIT/Stanford ECE Department)
4. What is the extent of overlap between two departments of a particular University in terms of skills for particular domains (say, How much are ECE and CSE Depts focussing on Machine Learning separately)
5. Are course offerings a direct reflection of industry requirements?
How does the present job requirements from different companies map to the course offerings?
Has the change in industry investments in R&D been reflected in the change in course offerings over time?


## Data Set Used
1. Primary: Course catalogs over the last 20 years, from Universities, all publicly available, need to be scraped and cleaned. 
2. Current industry requirements can be mapped from Job descriptions posted publicly, from Top companies in different domains. (for question 5.a)
3. Industry data can be collected from financial reports. (for question 5.b)
