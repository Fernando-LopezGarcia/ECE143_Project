Electrical Engineering Courses
EE 15N. The Art and Science of Engineering Design. 3 Units.
The goal of this seminar is to introduce freshmen to the design process
associated with an engineering project. The seminar will consist of a series
of lectures. The first part of each lecture will focus on the different design
aspects of an engineering project, including formation of the design team,
developing a project statement, generating design ideas and specifications,
finalizing the design, and reporting the outcome. Students will form teams
to follow these procedures in designing a term project of their choice over
the quarter. The second part of each lecture will consist of outside speakers,
including founders of some of the most exciting companies in Silicon
Valley, who will share their experiences about engineering design. Onsite
visits to Silicon Valley companies to showcase their design processes
will also be part of the course. The seminar serves three purposes: (1) it
introduces students to the design process of turning an idea into a final
design, (2) it presents the different functions that people play in a project,
and (3) it gives students a chance to consider what role in a project would
be best suited to their interests and skills.

EE 17N. Engineering the Micro and Nano Worlds: From Chips to
Genes. 3 Units.
Preference to freshmen. The first part is hands-on micro- and nanofabrication
including the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility (SNF) and the
Stanford Nanocharacterization Laboratory (SNL) and field trips to local
companies and other research centers to illustrate the many applications;
these include semiconductor integrated circuits (’chips’), DNA microarrays,
microfluidic bio-sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
The second part is to create, design, propose and execute a project. Most
of the grade will be based on the project. By the end of the course you
will, of course, be able to read critically a New York Times article on
nanotechnology. More importantly you will have experienced the challenge
(and fun) of designing, carrying out and presenting your own experimental
project. As a result you will be better equipped to choose your major. This
course can complement (and differs from) the seminars offered by Profs
Philip Wong and Hari Manoharan in that it emphasizes laboratory work
and an experimental student-designed project. Prerequisites: high-school
physics.
EE 21N. What is Nanotechnology?. 3 Units.
Nanotechnology is an often used word and it means many things to
different people. Scientists and Engineers have some notion of what
nanotechnology is, societal perception may be entirely different. In this
course, we start with the classic paper by Richard Feynman ("There’s
Plenty of Room at the Bottom"), which laid down the challenge to the
nanotechnologists. Then we discuss two classic books that offer a glimpse
of what nanotechnology is: Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of
Nanotechnology by Eric Drexler, and Prey by Michael Crichton. Drexler’s
thesis sparked the imagination of what nano machinery might do, whereas
Crichton’s popular novel channeled the public’s attention to this subject by
portraying a disastrous scenario of a technology gone astray. We will use
the scientific knowledge to analyze the assumptions and predictions of these
classic works. We will draw upon the latest research advances to illustrate
the possibilities and impossibilities of nanotechnology.

to play with interesting electronics and ultimately to develop a creative final
project.
